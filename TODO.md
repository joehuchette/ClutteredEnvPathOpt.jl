# TODO

<!-- 1. Turn graph into a matrix - DONE
2. JuMP.Model(Gurobi.Optimizer) - DONE
3. compare min cover size with what we're getting - DONE

1. Get some stats balance, sep size
2. Get tree structure - DONE

1. Still draw the triangles in the biclique graphs - DONE

1. Dont put the face in the feg algo - DONE -->

1. Plot optimal solution - DONE
2. Run biclique with all sep algo individually (LT BEST)
3. Run sep algo on generated obstacle courses (ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE THE GRID)
4. Plot tree structure in a more intuitive way (graphviz) - DONE

1. Check FEG is correct
2. check model
3. If only one child solve w/o recursion?
